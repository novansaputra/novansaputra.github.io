							<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
							<p>
							I'm a student from Indonesia currently studying astrophysics in Japan. My research focuses on galaxy evolution, with a particular interest in quiescent galaxies. I study them by analyzing the spatial distribution of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Outside of astrophysics, I enjoy traveling, music, and photography. Feel free to connect with me on Instagram: <a href="https://instagram.com/novansaputra_" target="_blank">@novansaputra_</a>!

								<h3 class="major">Massive Quiescent Galaxies</h3>
							
								Quiescent galaxies in the early universe provide crucial insights into how star formation shuts down and galaxies evolve structurally over time. Interestingly, massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift (~11 billion years ago) are much more compact than similar galaxies today, raising questions about their rapid formation and growth. 
								<br>
								<br>
								My research explores the physical origins of this compactness using spatially resolved SED fitting with piXedfit and deep JWST imaging. By analyzing the internal distributions of stellar mass and star formation, I investigate evolutionary scenarios such as inside-out quenching, minor mergers, and central compaction to understand how these dense early systems evolve into the extended quiescent galaxies seen in the present-day universe.
